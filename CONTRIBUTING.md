We appreciate code contributions! Please follow these steps:

3.  **Create a new branch** for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name` or `git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description`.
4.  **Make your changes.** Ensure your code adheres to the existing code style.
5.  **Test your changes.** Run `flutter test` and ensure all tests pass. If you add new features, please add corresponding tests.
6.  **Commit your changes** with a clear and descriptive commit message.
7.  **Push your branch** to your forked repository.

    - Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
    - Reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`, `Closes #456`).
    - Ensure all checks pass.

## Code Style
- Follow the [Dart Style Guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style).
- Use `flutter format` to format your code before committing.

## Testing
- All new features and bug fixes should be covered by tests.
- Run tests using `flutter test`.

## Branching Policy
- We use a `main` branch for stable releases.
- All new features and bug fixes should be developed in separate branches and merged into `main` via Pull Requests.

## Environment Variables
- Sensitive information (e.g., Firebase API keys) should be managed using environment variables or a secure configuration system, and never committed directly to the repository.

## Security
- If you discover any security vulnerabilities, please report them responsibly by contacting the maintainers directly, rather than opening a public issue.
